**Neoluma** is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed to be *a language for everything*. 
Whether you're crafting a quick script on your knee or developing a large operating system, Neoluma is made with developer experience in mind. Featuring a clean, Python-JS-like syntax with the structure and power of C++ & C# - it's expressive, efficient, and built for modern development.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Clean, modern syntax** inspired by Python, JavaScript, and C#
- **Static typing** with **type inference** for simplicity and safety
- Rich type system, including a custom fixed-point `number` type, plus `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `set`, `dict`, `array`, `result`, and more
- Powerful decorators like `@entry`, `@comptime`, `@unsafe`, `@override`, and others
- Flexible preprocessor directives for low-level and modular control:
  - `#import` ‚Äî import local or external modules (e.g., C++ bindings)
  - `#unsafe` ‚Äî enable pointer operations
  - `#baremetal` ‚Äî target hardware directly
  - `#macro` ‚Äî define macros for compile-time logic
- **Built-in async/await** for concurrency
- **Compile-time evaluation** and an evolving **macro system (WIP)**
- **Configurable memory management** ‚Äî *automatic* or *manual*, your choice
- **Cross-platform compilation with LLVM backend** for native performance
- **IDE support (planned)** ‚Äî syntax highlighting, debugging, and project tools

## üìÉ File Formats

- `.nm` ‚Äî **Neoluma Module**: source code
- `.nlp` ‚Äî **Neoluma Project**: project structure/configuration

```
project_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.nm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.nm
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project.nlp
```

## üß© Example

```neoluma
@entry
fn main() {
    name = "Neoluma";
    print("Hello, ${name}!")
}
```
> If the function doesn't have a return type, it is `void` by default ‚Äî no `return` required.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage (planned CLI)

```bash
neoluma build project.nlp #compiled way
neoluma run main.nm #interpreted way
```


## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Semantic Analyzer (~10%)
- [ ] LLVM IR Compiler
- [ ] CLI Toolchain
- [ ] Cross-platform support (Linux / Windows / macOS / Android / iOS / etc.)
- [ ] Plugin system and editor integration
- [ ] Transpilation support (C++, JS, etc.)

## üï∂Ô∏è Vision

Neoluma aims to be a unified language that bridges low-level control and high-level productivity. It is designed for:

- Systems programming (including OS kernels)
- Cross-platform apps and utilities
- Educational tools and experimentation
- Scripting with performance
- Future self-hosting development

## üö¶ Status

Neoluma is in early development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
